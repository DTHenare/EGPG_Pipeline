Software will open a netstation file and process it using best practice procedures with minimal user input. The user will only need to define the location of the files, the relevant event markers, and the time windows of interest. Each participant's data will be opened, converted to a .set file, filtered, broken channels interpolated, average referenced, epoched, artifact rejected, ICA cleaned, split into conditions and averaged for each condition. The software will output details about the results of various steps of the processing (number and identity of interpolated channels, number of epochs generated, number of epochs rejected for each condition as well as total, and number of components rejected), as well as publication quality figures (showing averaged ERPs for each condition, topographies at relevant time points, and eye channels), and a 3D matrix of data containing voltages representing participants x time x condition.
