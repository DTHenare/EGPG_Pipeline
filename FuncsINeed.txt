Functions I need

open trigger file and save indices
5 = fopen('C:\Users\Dion\Desktop\dssr2017-DTHenare\triggerNames.txt')
C = textscan(5, '%s')
Blah = C{1,1}

# popup navigates to file
[testflie,testfolder] = uigetfile
# finds all of the .RAW files in the folder that was navigated to
dir(strcat(testfolder,'\*.RAW'))
